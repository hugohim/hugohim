## Hi there 👋

My name is Hugo Thim, and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate looking for new opportunities to grow and contribute!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Wellpal, an AI healthcare chatbot 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React native and Firebase
- 😎 I recently built a cloud-based stock updater using AWS Lambda, S3, and Shopify’s GraphQL API.
